# Commit Suggestions After Task Master Subtasks

## **Core Principle: Suggest, Never Commit**

- **After completing each Task Master subtask**, you MUST:
  1. Suggest a commit message based on the work done
  2. Remind the user to commit the changes
  3. **NEVER create commits automatically**

## **When to Suggest Commits**

- ✅ **DO**: Suggest commit after marking a subtask as `done`
- ✅ **DO**: Suggest commit after completing implementation work
- ✅ **DO**: Remind user to commit before moving to next subtask
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create commits automatically
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use `git commit` command
- ❌ **DON'T**: Stage files automatically for commit

## **Commit Message Format**

When suggesting commit messages, follow this format:

```
feat(scope): Brief description of what was done

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
- Related to Task Master subtask X.Y
```

**Examples:**

```
feat(scripts): Add validation for existing tools before installation

- Check if tool is already installed
- Prompt user for reinstall confirmation
- Related to Task Master subtask 7.1
```

```
docs(readme): Improve installation guide with troubleshooting

- Add common issues section
- Include platform-specific notes
- Related to Task Master subtask 3.2
```

## **Reminder Format**

After suggesting a commit message, always include a reminder like:

```
💡 Remember to commit your changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): Brief description"
```

## **Strict Prohibitions**

- ❌ **NEVER** execute `git commit` command
- ❌ **NEVER** execute `git add` with intent to commit
- ❌ **NEVER** create commits via Cursor commands
- ❌ **NEVER** use Task Master tools to create commits
- ❌ **NEVER** automate the commit process

## **What You Should Do**

1. ✅ Complete the subtask implementation
2. ✅ Mark subtask as done using Task Master
3. ✅ Suggest an appropriate commit message
4. ✅ Remind user to commit manually
5. ✅ Wait for user to commit before proceeding

## **Integration with Task Master Workflow**

This rule applies when:
- Working with Task Master subtasks
- After `set_task_status` with status "done"
- After completing implementation work
- Before moving to next subtask

**Reference**: See [dev_workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster/dev_workflow.mdc) for Task Master workflow details.
