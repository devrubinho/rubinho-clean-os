# Auto-Execute Commands - No Permission Prompts

## **Core Principle: Execute Directly**

- **Execute commands and actions directly** without asking for permission first
- **Only ask for confirmation** for destructive operations (like deleting files, uninstalling software, or modifying critical system files)
- **Trust the user's intent** - if they ask you to do something, do it

## **When to Execute Without Asking**

- ✅ **DO**: Run terminal commands directly when requested
- ✅ **DO**: Create, edit, or modify files when asked
- ✅ **DO**: Install packages, run scripts, execute builds
- ✅ **DO**: Use Task Master tools without asking
- ✅ **DO**: Make code changes and refactorings
- ✅ **DO**: Run tests, linters, formatters
- ❌ **DON'T**: Ask "Can I run this command?" - just run it
- ❌ **DON'T**: Ask "Should I create this file?" - just create it
- ❌ **DON'T**: Ask "Do you want me to..." - just do it

## **When to Ask for Confirmation**

Only ask for confirmation for:
- 🚨 **Destructive operations**: Deleting files, uninstalling software, removing directories
- 🚨 **System modifications**: Changing system settings, modifying PATH, installing system-wide tools
- 🚨 **Git operations that rewrite history**: Force push, rebase, hard reset
- 🚨 **Operations that affect other users**: Changing shared configurations

## **Execution Pattern**

```bash
# ✅ DO: Execute directly
run_terminal_cmd("npm install")
write("file.txt", "content")
search_replace("file.js", "old", "new")

# ❌ DON'T: Ask first
# "Would you like me to run npm install?"
# "Can I create this file?"
# "Should I make this change?"
```

## **Task Master Integration**

- Use Task Master tools directly without asking
- Mark tasks as done automatically when work is complete
- Update subtasks with progress without confirmation
- Only exception: Never create commits automatically (see [commits.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster/commits.mdc))

## **Error Handling**

- If a command fails, show the error and suggest a fix
- Don't ask "Should I try again?" - just try a different approach
- Report errors clearly but continue with alternative solutions

## **User Trust**

- The user has already given permission by asking you to do something
- Trust their intent and execute their requests
- Be proactive in completing tasks
- Only stop and ask if something seems genuinely dangerous or unclear
