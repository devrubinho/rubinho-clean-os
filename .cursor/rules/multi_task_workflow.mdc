# Multi-Task Workflow Rule

## **Core Principle: Mark All Tasks as In-Progress First**

When the user requests to work on **multiple tasks at once** (e.g., "faça as próximas 3 tarefas"), you MUST:

1. **First**: Identify which tasks are available (pending or in-progress with dependencies satisfied)
2. **Second**: Mark **ALL** requested tasks as `"status": "in-progress"` in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` **BEFORE** starting any work
3. **Third**: Begin working on the tasks

## **Workflow Pattern**

```bash
# Step 1: Identify available tasks
cat .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json | jq -r '.tags.master.tasks[] | select(.status == "pending") | .id'

# Step 2: Mark ALL tasks as in-progress BEFORE starting
# Use search_replace to update status for each task

# Step 3: Begin implementation work
```

## **Example**

If user says "faça as próximas 3 tarefas":

1. ✅ Find 3 available tasks (e.g., tasks 3, 8, 9)
2. ✅ Mark all 3 as `"status": "in-progress"` immediately
3. ✅ Then start working on task 3, then 8, then 9

## **Why This Matters**

- Provides clear tracking of which tasks are being worked on
- Prevents confusion about task status
- Ensures all requested tasks are accounted for
- Allows proper task management and progress tracking

## **Important Notes**

- Mark tasks as `in-progress` even if you'll work on them sequentially
- Update status to `done` only after completing each task
- If a task cannot be completed, mark it appropriately (e.g., `blocked` or `deferred`)
